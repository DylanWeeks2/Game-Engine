# **<ins>Overview</ins>**  
This project is the C++ game engine that is used to make all my personal projects and games. This game engine contains a DirectX 11 rendering pipeline, a 2D/3D math and physics library, and systems for important gameplay functionality such as audio, input, events, etc.


**Tools:** C++, HLSL, DirectX 11  
**Development Timeline:** August 2022 â€“ Present

This game engine contains the following systems:  
- Audio system (FMOD)
- Input system (mouse, keyboard, Xbox controller)
- Event system
- Debug rendering system
- Development console
- TCP networking system
- Multithreaded job system
- Parsers for XML, OBJ, 3DSprite, TXT, and binary files




### **2D/3D Math and Physics Library**  
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebdacf4e-8c7e-4ff5-85d8-bd38517019c1

The math and physics library supports the following features:
- Physics simulations for 3D rigid body dynamics and particle-based Position Based Dynamics
- Collisions detections for any convex polygon or polyhedron (SAT, GJK, and EPA)
- Spatial partitioning algorithms for BVH, bit-buckets, and quad trees
- Raycasts for AABBs, OBBs, capsules, cylinders, discs, spheres, lines, planes, and convex hulls
- General math utilities for dot product, cross product, projected lengths, easing functions, splines, interpolation, etc.




### **DirectX 11 Rendering Pipeline**  
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a60be2ee-e2e8-4ec1-8f86-a5f159f6af76

This engine contains a DirectX 11 rendering pipeline to support texturing, HLSL shaders, sprite animations, sprite sheets, bitmap fonts, render target/depth stencil effects, specular maps, and normal maps.
